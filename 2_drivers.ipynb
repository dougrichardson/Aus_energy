    "We want to look at climate features during low energy events:\n",
    "1. Daily events: solar and wind lulls. Pick out most spatially extensive lull-days (separate for each season, e.g. sum lulls over all regions, pick top 10% winter days.\n",
    "    - daily circulation composites: MSLP, 500gph, 200gph. Do we get H/Ls in similar positions? What is the jet doing? Maybe a plot of wind vectors - nice to see the direction and speed?\n",
    "2. Anomalous seasons: sum number of events over a season and look at the largest. Sub-question: do we get consecutive seasons with lots of regions experiencing events? This might go better in an earlier notebook.\n",
    "    - modes of variability: SST, the variable used to calculate SAM. What do ENSO, IOD, SAM look like?\n",
    "    \n",
    "And, we want to do this the other way around. Do ENSO, IOD, SAM years lead us to energy lulls?"
